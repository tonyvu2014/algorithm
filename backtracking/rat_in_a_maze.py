# You are given a maze in the form of a matrix of size n * m. Each cell is either clear or blocked denoted by 1 and 0 respectively.
# A rat sits at the top-left cell and there exists a block of cheese at the bottom-right cell. Both these cells are guaranteed to be clear.
# You need to find if the rat can get the cheese if it can move only in one of the two directions - down and right. It canâ€™t move to blocked cells.


# Backtracking algorithm, check if we can get to the cheese from the 
# cell on the right or from the cell at the bottom
# if yes, then return True, else return False
